Hey everyone! I'm emjsavarese, and I am some type of programmer!
My dream is to be a game developer someday, but for now I'm just trying to learn new languages and gain more skills in general!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#! And Unity kind of. It's a work in progress.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with surprisingly, git. It was working while I was in college, and now I seem to be fighting for my life against it. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her/hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I taught myself how to knit and crochet purely through envy. I was so mad that everyone else could use fancy yarn and I couldn't, and so here I am now!
